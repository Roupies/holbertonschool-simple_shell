.TH HSH 1 "26 April 2025" "v1.0" "Holberton Simple Shell"
.SH NAME
hsh \- minimalist UNIX-like command-line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIscript-file\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hsh
program is a simple shell that reads and executes commands from standard input or from a script file. It mimics basic POSIX shell behavior:

.IP “•” 2
Displays a prompt when run interactively.

.IP “•” 2
Parses each input line into a command and zero or more arguments.

.IP “•” 2
Searches for executable programs in the directories listed in the \fIPATH\fR environment variable.

.IP “•” 2
Executes external commands with
.B execve(2)
in a child process created by
.B fork(2).

.IP “•” 2
Supports a small set of built-in commands: \fIexit\fR and \fIenv\fR, plus the special parameter \fI$?\fR for the last exit status.

.IP “•” 2
Handles end-of-file (Ctrl+D) and interrupts (Ctrl+C) gracefully.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Display a short usage summary and exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print the shell version (v1.0) and exit.

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
.TP
\fBexit [\fIstatus\fR]\fR
Terminate the shell. If \fIstatus\fR is provided, return that status; otherwise, return the status of the last executed command.

.TP
\fIenv\fR
Print all environment variables, one per line, in the form \fIKEY=VALUE\fR.

.TP
\fI$?\fR
When entered as the sole “command,” print the exit status of the most recently executed command.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fIPATH\fR
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for executable commands. If not set, no external commands will be found.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fI/etc/profile\fR
System-wide initialization file (not used by hsh by default).

.TP
\fI~/.hshrc\fR
User initialization file (not implemented in this version).

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
Success (no errors and user did not signal exit).

.TP
>0
If a built-in or external command exits with a non-zero status, that status is returned.  
126 — Command found but not executable (permission denied).  
127 — Command not found.  
128+n — Command terminated by signal n.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
\fBCtrl+C\fR (SIGINT)
Interrupts the current input; prompt is redisplayed.  
\fBCtrl+D\fR (EOF)
End-of-file: shell exits, returning the last command’s status.
